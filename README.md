# 👋 Hi, I am Yuan

Welcome to my corner of the internet.  
I build small, creative projects that combine product thinking, data storytelling and playful design. I enjoy turning messy ideas into simple tools that make life clearer, easier and a little more fun.

## 🚧 Projects in Progress

### 🏙️ If Cities Had a UX Designer  
A product thinking case study comparing the user experience of London and Shanghai as if both cities were digital products. I am currently building out user journeys, friction points and opportunity maps for both cities.

### 🧃 Return on Energy  
My active productivity experiment. I am tracking caffeine habits, energy levels and behaviour patterns to design my own Return on Energy framework. I am improving the data structure and the visual storytelling.

### 📊 Grafana Transport Dashboard  
I am updating my Kings Cross real time transport dashboard to submit it to the Grafana community. Improvements include cleaner visual layers, refined panels and stronger storytelling around movement and flow.
