# 👋 Hi, I’m Yuan-Yuan

Welcome to my corner of the internet 🌿

I build small, creative projects that combine product thinking, data storytelling, and playful design. I enjoy turning messy ideas into simple tools that make life clearer, easier, and a little more fun.

This GitHub is where I experiment, learn in public, and ship.

## ✨ New Year, Same Me (2026 Edition)

Going into 2026, my focus is simple:
build thoughtfully, document clearly, and enjoy the process.

When life gives you lemons, remember lemons are made of two fruits.  
Mine are made of drive and attitude 🍋

## 🎯 Current Focus (This Month)

- Progressing one core project rather than many small ones  
- Improving visual storytelling and documentation quality  
- Adding screenshots and explanations to existing repositories  
- Exploring creative uses of public data and light automation  

---

## 📅 How I Use GitHub

I update this profile monthly rather than weekly.

Each month usually includes:
- One meaningful improvement to a project  
- Clearer visuals or documentation  
- Reflection on what worked and what did not  

This helps me stay consistent without rushing ideas.
